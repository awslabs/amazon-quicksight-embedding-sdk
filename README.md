# Amazon QuickSight Embedding SDK
Thank you for using the Amazon QuickSight JavaScript SDK. You can use this SDK to embed Amazon QuickSight dashboards on HTML pages within your web applications.

## Usage
Before you can embed an Amazon QuickSight dashboard, you need to publish it and ensure that users are granted necessary permissions. For more information, see  [Embedding Amazon QuickSight Dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/embedding-dashboards.html) in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide..

After a dashboard is ready to be embedded, follow the steps below to embed an Amazon QuickSight dashboard in this [example](#example):

### Step 1: Download and include QuickSight Embedding SDK
Do one of the following:

-  Option 1: Use the Amazon QuickSight Embedding SDK in the browser:
```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk@1.0.3/dist/quicksight-embedding-js-sdk.min.js" />
```

-  Option 2: Install and use the QuickSight Embedding SDK in Node.js:
```shell
    npm install amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk
```
```javascript
    var QuickSightEmbedding = require("amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk");
```
You can also use ES6 import syntax in place of require:
```
    import { embedDashboard } from 'amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk';
    
    const dashboard = embedDashboard(options);
```
Alternatively, if you need to load the entire module:
```
    import * as QuicksightEmbedding from 'amazon-quicksight-embedding-sdk';

    const dashboard = QuickSightEmbedding.embedDashboard(options);
```

### Step 2: Configure the dashboard to embed
Set up the dashboard so you can embed it.
```javascript
    var options = {
        url: "https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/dashboards/dashboardId?isauthcode=true&identityprovider=quicksight&code=authcode",
        container: document.getElementById("dashboardContainer"),
        parameters: {
            country: "United States"
            states: [
                "California",
                "Washington"
            ]
        },
        scrolling: "no",
        height: "700px",
        width: "1000px"
    };
```
#### Url element (required)
If you haven't done it yet, follow [Embedding Amazon QuickSight Dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/embedding-dashboards.html) in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide to generate the url.

#### Container element (required)
The `container` element is the parent HTMLElement where we're going to embed the dashboard. You can make it one of the following: 

-  Option 1: It can be an HTMLElement:
```javascript
    container: document.getElementById("dashboardContainer"),
```
-  Option 2: Or, it can be a query selector string:
```javascript
    container: "#dashboardContainer",
```

#### Parameters element (optional)
The `parameters` element is an object that contains key:value pairs for parameters names:values.
It allows you to set initial parameter values for your dashboard. Pass an array as value for multi-value parameters.
For more information about parameters in Amazon QuickSight, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/parameters-in-quicksight.html

#### Scrolling element (optional)
The `scrolling` element lets you set up a specific scrolling experience for the iFrame that holds your dashboard. Available values are `auto`, `yes`,
and `no`. The default value is `no`.

#### Width element and height element (optional)
You can set `width` and `height` for the iFrame that holds your dashboard. Both of these default to 100%. You can set them to be fixed values:
```javascript
    height: "700px",
    width: "1000px"
```

Or, relative values:
```javascript
    height: "80%",
    width: "60%"
```

To make your embedded dashboard responsive,  don't set `width` or `height` (leave them at the default: `100%`). Then make the container HTMLElement responsive to screen size change.


You can also choose to set height to be `AutoFit` to make the iFrame fit your dashboard height. Use `loadingHeight` to specify the height you'd like to use before actual dashboard height is known:
```javascript
    height: "AutoFit",
    loadingHeight: '700px',
```

Note: With AutoFit height enabled, the dashboard's modal (such as modal shown when selected "Export to CSV" for a Table visual) could be hidden
if the dashboard content is larger than the screen. To solve the issue, you can add the following code to auto-scroll the focus to the modal.
```
dashboard.on("SHOW_MODAL_EVENT", () => {
    window.scrollTo({
        top: 0 // iFrame top position
    });
});
```

#### ClassName element (optional)
The `className` element lets you add additional class names to the iFrame that holds your dashboard.

### Step 3: Embed the dashboard

Embed the dashboard by calling:
```javascript
    var dashboard = QuickSightEmbedding.embedDashboard(options);
```
This returns a dashboard object for further action.


### Step 4: Setup load callback (optional)

If you want your application to get notified and respond when the Amazon QuickSight dashboard is fully loaded, use a load callback. Choose one of the following:

-  Use options:
```javascript
    loadCallback: yourLoadCallback,
```

- Or, register the "load" event on the returned dashboard object:
```javascript
    dashboard.on("load", yourLoadCallback);
```


### Step 5: Setup error callback (optional)

If you want your application get notified and respond when QuickSight dashboard fails to load, use a error callback. Choose one of the following:

- Use options:
```javascript
    errorCallback: yourErrorCallback,
```

- Or, register the "error" event on the returned dashboard object:
```javascript
     dashboard.on("error", yourErrorCallback);
```

We pass a payload object to your callback function with a specific `payload.errorCode`. Currently, the error codes are:

- `Forbidden` -- the URL's authentication code expired 

- `Unauthorized` -- the session obtained from the authentication code expired

If you follow the instructions to generate the correct URL, but you still receive these error codes, you need to generate a new URL.


### Step 6: Update parameter values (optional)
Use `dashboard.setParameters()` to update parameter values. Pass an array as value for multi-value parameters.
You can build your own UI to trigger this, so that viewers of the embedded dashboard can control the dashboard from your app page.
```javascript
    dashboard.setParameters({country: "China", states: ["Zhejiang", "Jiangsu"]});
```

To reset a parameter so that it includes all values, you can pass the string `"[ALL]"`.
```javascript
    dashboard.setParameters({country: "China", states: "[ALL]" });
```


## Troubleshooting
1. Make sure the url you provide in options is not encoded. Don't encode the url as it changes the authcode in the url and breaks the url. Also check that the url responded from server side is not encoded.
2. Some browsers (e.g. mobile safari) have default setting to "Always Block Cookies". Change the setting to either "Allow form Websites I Visit" or "Always Allow".

            }

            function onError(payload) {
                console.log("Do something when the dashboard fails loading");
            }

            function embedDashboard() {
                var containerDiv = document.getElementById("dashboardContainer");
                var options = {
                    url: "https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/dashboards/dashboardId?isauthcode=true&identityprovider=quicksight&code=authcode",

                    },
                    scrolling: "no",
                    height: "700px",
                    width: "1000px"
                };

                dashboard.on("error", onError);
                dashboard.on("load", onDashboardLoad);
            }

            function onCountryChange(obj) {
                dashboard.setParameters({country: obj.value});
            }
        </script>
    </head>

    <body onload="embedDashboard()">
        <span>
            <label for="country">Country</label>
            <select id="country" name="country" onchange="onCountryChange(this)">
                <option value="United States">United States</option>
                <option value="Mexico">Mexico</option>
                <option value="Canada">Canada</option>
            </select>
